# Wiki-View

This code is a Python program that uses the Wikipedia API to retrieve information about a given topic, it then uses the information obtained to display a summary of the topic on a Tkinter Text Widget, and also it extracts the first image from the Wikipedia article and displays it on a Tkinter Label Widget. The code first imports the necessary libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, PIL, and Tkinter. Then it defines a function named get_wikipedia_summary which takes in a single argument, the topic the user wants to look up. The function first uses the Wikipedia API to get the page of the topic provided by the user and check if the page exists. If the page exists, it then gets the summary of the page and displays it on the Tkinter text widget, it also calls a helper function get_wikipedia_image that takes the page as an argument to extract the first image from the Wikipedia article and display it on a Tkinter Label Widget. If the page doesn't exist, the function displays a message to the user "Page not found" on the Tkinter text widget. If there is a wikipedia.exceptions.DisambiguationError it will handle it and display "Multiple pages found, please be more specific" on the Tkinter text widget. Finally, it has a general exception that will catch all other exception and display an error message to the user on the Tkinter text widget.
